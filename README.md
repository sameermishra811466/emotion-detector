# emotion-detector

🎭 Emotion Detection System using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Emotion Detection System that identifies human emotions from facial expressions using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
It analyzes images or video frames, detects faces, and predicts the dominant emotion such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, etc.

The project demonstrates practical use of AI + Computer Vision and is suitable for academic projects, internships, and portfolio showcasing.

🚀 Features

Face detection from images or video

Emotion classification using a trained deep learning model

Real-time emotion prediction support

Clean and simple implementation

Easily extendable for live webcam input

🧠 Emotions Detected

Happy 😊

Sad 😔

Angry 😠

Surprise 😲

Neutral 😐

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV

Deep Learning (CNN)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab / Local Environment

⚙️ How It Works (Workflow)

Input image or video frame is captured

Face is detected using OpenCV

Face region is preprocessed (resize, normalize)

Deep learning model predicts emotion

Predicted emotion is displayed on the face

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

2️⃣ Run the Python script
python emotion.py

3️⃣ Notebook execution

Open emotiondetector.ipynb and run all cells.

📊 Results

The system successfully classifies emotions with good accuracy on clear facial images.

Performs well under normal lighting conditions.

Suitable for academic demonstrations and real-time emotion analysis prototypes.

💡 Applications

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)

Mental health monitoring

Customer feedback analysis

Smart surveillance systems

AI-based interview or classroom analysis

🧪 Future Improvements

Improve accuracy using larger datasets

Add real-time webcam support

Deploy as a web application

Integrate audio-based emotion detection

Add emotion analytics dashboard
